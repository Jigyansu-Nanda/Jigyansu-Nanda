## Hi there ! 
I am Jigyansu. I am a textile undergraduate student at IIT Delhi, who loves programming. I thrive to be a better programmer every day. Also recently i have started Competitive Programming, which is quite fun.

### Check out my articles on GeeksForGeeks: üëâüèº [Jigyansu's Articles](https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/jigyansu/articles)

### My Projects:
    - [Shortest Path Algorithms Visualizer Web Application](https://jigyansu-nanda.github.io/Shortest-Path-Algorithms-Visualizer/):</br>
    This is a tool to help visualize how the algorithms, used for solving Shortest Path Problem, work in real time. Implemented algorithms: BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman Ford algorithm, Floyd Warshall algorithm.</br>
    **Tools used:** `ReactJS`, `Javascript`, `HTML`, `CSS`
    - [LFU Cache replacement scheme](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/LFU-cache-replacement-scheme):</br>
    Implementation of LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache eviction scheme in O(1) complexity, that prioritizes cache replacement based on frequency of item-usage, when frequency is same we evict least recently used item from cache block.</br>
    **Tools used:** `Java`
    - [Optimal Number of Components in PCA](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Number-of-Components-in-PCA):</br> 
    Implementation of a statistical approach to decide optimal number of Components in Principal Component Analysis, using Explained-Variance without losing significant algorithmic accuracy.</br>
    **Tools used:** `Python`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`

### Current Goals:
    - Be an -International Grandmaster at Codeforces.
    - Contribute more in projects.
